## Reflection

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure functionality by writing JUnit tests that check each requirement and by including edge cases. To make code secure, I validate inputs, handle exceptions, and avoid risky practices like hardcoding sensitive values. Testing early and often helps catch issues before they affect users.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I break user requirements into small, testable features. For example, in Project One, I turned the requirement to manage contacts into methods for adding, updating, and deleting contacts, then created unit tests to confirm the requirements were met.

### How do I approach designing software?
I design software with modular, object-oriented principles. I keep methods small and classes focused on a single responsibility, which makes them easier to test and maintain. I also design with testing in mind, so every function can be validated independently.
